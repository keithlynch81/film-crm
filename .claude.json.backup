That’s not needed on here. With those things moved or deleted, the idea title should fill the full width of the box if needed.

Maybe reducing the size of the dropdown and the text size to make it fit.\nThe following changes should be done to Both layouts:\nIn a specific Contact’s page, can we change the ‘Edit Contact’ button to just be ‘Edit’ and maybe make it a blue pill button.
