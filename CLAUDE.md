## Key Technical Decisions

### Styling Architecture:

- **Responsive design** - Mobile-first approach using Chakra's responsive features
- **Fallback**: Inline CSS only when Chakra doesn't provide suitable component

### Authentication Flow:
- Supabase Auth with email confirmation
- Custom redirect handling for workspace invitations
- Automatic "Personal" workspace creation on signup

### Workspace System:
- RLS policies for data isolation between workspaces
- Role-based permissions (owner/admin/member)

## Design System
### Chakra UI Integration:
- **Primary Library**: Use Chakra UI components for all new development
- **Component Mapping**:
  - Buttons → `<Button>` with `colorScheme="blue"` for primary actions
  - Forms → `<FormControl>`, `<Input>`, `<Select>`, `<Textarea>`
  - Layout → `<Box>`, `<Flex>`, `<Grid>`, `<Container>`, `<Stack>`
  - Navigation → `<Breadcrumb>`, responsive `<Box>` with `<Hide>`/`<Show>`
  - Tables → `<Table>`, `<Tbody>`, `<Tr>`, `<Td>` with responsive features
  - Cards → `<Card>` or `<Box>` with `shadow` and `borderRadius`
  - Modals → `<Modal>`, `<AlertDialog>` for confirmations

### Responsive Design Guidelines:
- **Mobile-first**: Use Chakra's array syntax `[base, md, lg]` for responsive props
- **Breakpoints**: Follow Chakra's default breakpoints (sm: 30em, md: 48em, lg: 62em, xl: 80em)
- **Navigation**: Use `<Hide>`/`<Show>` for mobile hamburger menus
- **Typography**: Use `<Heading>` and `<Text>` with responsive fontSize

### Colors (Chakra Theme):
- Primary Blue: #3b82f6 (blue.500 in Chakra)
- Background: #f9fafb (gray.50)
- Text: #111827 (gray.900), #374151 (gray.700), #6b7280 (gray.500)
- Success: #16a34a (green.600), Error: #dc2626 (red.600)

### Legacy Components (being migrated):
- **Pill Buttons**: Migrating to `<Button borderRadius="full">`
- **Form Inputs**: Migrating to `<FormControl>` patterns
- **Cards**: Migrating to `<Card>` or `<Box>` with consistent shadows
- **Status Pills**: Migrating to `<Badge>` components
