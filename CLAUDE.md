### Recent Features Completed (Responsive UX Session):
1. **Projects Page Improvements** - Fixed tags and genres visibility on desktop table layout - now visible in right corner on same line as project title
2. **Notebook Page Enhancements** - Removed notebook icon from heading, added collapsible filters with search input and "Show Filters" button (matching Projects page UX)
3. **Project Detail Page Polish** - Changed "Edit Project" button to "Edit" with blue pill styling, moved date to bottom-left to prevent mobile overlap
4. **Layout Consistency** - Improved responsive behavior across all pages with consistent button styling and better mobile/desktop separation

### Previous Features Completed (Market Intelligence Session):
1. **RSS Feed Parsing** - Automatic parsing from Variety.com, Deadline.com, Screen Daily with XML processing
2. **Smart Article Matching** - Algorithm matches industry news articles to contacts/companies/projects
3. **Contact Page Integration** - Market Intelligence section appears on contact pages when matches found
4. **Admin Tools** - Complete debug interface at `/admin/market-intelligence` with RSS testing
5. **Database Architecture** - Full schema with news_articles, matching tables, and RLS policies
6. **Service Role Authentication** - Proper admin access for cross-workspace article matching
7. **UI Improvements** - Hide Market Intelligence section when no matches (better UX)

## Database Schema
### Core Tables:
- `workspaces` - Multi-tenant workspaces
- `workspace_members` - User-workspace relationships with roles
- `workspace_invites` - Invitation system with shareable links
- `projects` - Film/TV projects with metadata
- `contacts` - Industry contacts with company associations
- `submissions` - Project submissions to contacts
- `meetings` - Scheduled meetings and events (includes meeting_link field)
- `contact_talking_points` - Talking points linking contacts to projects for meeting prep
- `notifications` - System notifications (existing, working for contact creation)

### Market Intelligence Tables:
- `news_articles` - Industry news from RSS feeds (RLS disabled for global access)
- `news_contact_matches` - Links articles to contacts with confidence scores
- `news_company_matches` - Links articles to companies with confidence scores
- `news_project_matches` - Links articles to projects with confidence scores

### Junction Tables:
- `project_mediums`, `project_genres`, `project_budget_ranges`
- `contact_mediums`, `contact_genres`, `contact_budget_ranges`

### Reference Data:
- `mediums` (Film, TV, Streaming, etc.)
- `genres` (Drama, Comedy, Horror, etc.)
- `budget_ranges` (Medium-specific ranges for Film vs TV)

## Key Technical Decisions

### Styling Architecture:
- **Primary UI Library**: Chakra UI - Use Chakra components whenever possible for consistency and accessibility
- **Migration Strategy**: Gradually migrating from inline CSS to Chakra UI components
- **Blue pill design system** - Consistent rounded buttons and form elements (now using Chakra Button components)
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-first approach using Chakra's responsive features
- **Fallback**: Inline CSS only when Chakra doesn't provide suitable component

### Authentication Flow:
- Supabase Auth with email confirmation
- Custom redirect handling for workspace invitations
- Automatic "Personal" workspace creation on signup

### Workspace System:
- RLS policies for data isolation between workspaces
- Role-based permissions (owner/admin/member)
- Shareable invitation links (manual distribution)

## Environment Setup
- **Platform**: Ubuntu on Windows 10 PC
- **Development**: `npm run dev` on localhost:3001
- **Database**: Supabase hosted PostgreSQL

## Important SQL Files:
- `supabase/migration.sql` - Main database schema with RLS policies
- `talking-points-migration.sql` - Talking points table (APPLIED ✅)
- `add-meeting-link.sql` - Meeting link field (APPLIED ✅)

## Design System
### Chakra UI Integration:
- **Primary Library**: Use Chakra UI components for all new development
- **Component Mapping**:
  - Buttons → `<Button>` with `colorScheme="blue"` for primary actions
  - Forms → `<FormControl>`, `<Input>`, `<Select>`, `<Textarea>`
  - Layout → `<Box>`, `<Flex>`, `<Grid>`, `<Container>`, `<Stack>`
  - Navigation → `<Breadcrumb>`, responsive `<Box>` with `<Hide>`/`<Show>`
  - Tables → `<Table>`, `<Tbody>`, `<Tr>`, `<Td>` with responsive features
  - Cards → `<Card>` or `<Box>` with `shadow` and `borderRadius`
  - Modals → `<Modal>`, `<AlertDialog>` for confirmations

### Responsive Design Guidelines:
- **Mobile-first**: Use Chakra's array syntax `[base, md, lg]` for responsive props
- **Breakpoints**: Follow Chakra's default breakpoints (sm: 30em, md: 48em, lg: 62em, xl: 80em)
- **Navigation**: Use `<Hide>`/`<Show>` for mobile hamburger menus
- **Typography**: Use `<Heading>` and `<Text>` with responsive fontSize

### Colors (Chakra Theme):
- Primary Blue: #3b82f6 (blue.500 in Chakra)
- Background: #f9fafb (gray.50)
- Text: #111827 (gray.900), #374151 (gray.700), #6b7280 (gray.500)
- Success: #16a34a (green.600), Error: #dc2626 (red.600)

### Legacy Components (being migrated):
- **Pill Buttons**: Migrating to `<Button borderRadius="full">`
- **Form Inputs**: Migrating to `<FormControl>` patterns
- **Cards**: Migrating to `<Card>` or `<Box>` with consistent shadows
- **Status Pills**: Migrating to `<Badge>` components

## 🚨 DEPLOYMENT: Ready for Production Testing 🚀

- ✅ **Notebook Page**: Added collapsible filters with search functionality, removed inconsistent icon
- ✅ **Project Detail Page**: Blue pill "Edit" button with proper mobile positioning
- ✅ **Layout Consistency**: All changes tested locally and pushed to GitHub/Vercel

### Market Intelligence System Status (95% Complete):
**Outstanding Issue**: Notifications not firing for new article matches (non-critical for production)

### What's Working ✅:
- ✅ **RSS Parsing**: Variety (10 articles), Deadline (12 articles), Screen Daily (0 articles)
- ✅ **Article Storage**: 22+ articles saved successfully  
- ✅ **Smart Matching**: 6 contact matches found for Margot Robbie
- ✅ **Contact Integration**: Market Intelligence section appears on contact pages with matches
- ✅ **Admin Tools**: Full debug interface at `/admin/market-intelligence/debug`

- ✅ **Service Role Setup**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` configured and working
- ✅ **Existing Notifications**: 4 notifications working for contact creation

### Next Session Priority:
Continue with production deployment testing and any remaining TypeScript build fixes for Vercel deployment.

## Important SQL Files Status:
- `market-intelligence-migration.sql` - Market Intelligence tables (APPLIED ✅)
- `fix-rls-policies.sql` - RLS fixes for news articles (APPLIED ✅)  
- `talking-points-migration.sql` - Talking points table migration (APPLIED ✅)
- `add-meeting-link.sql` - Meeting link field migration (APPLIED ✅)
- `adapt-market-intelligence-notifications.sql` - Notification function (NEEDS DEBUG 🔍)

## Market Intelligence System Summary:
**What it does**: Automatically parses industry news from major trade publications (Variety, Deadline, Screen Daily), intelligently matches articles to your contacts using AI-powered text analysis, and integrates the results directly into contact detail pages.

**Current Status**: 95% complete - core functionality working, just notifications need final debugging.
