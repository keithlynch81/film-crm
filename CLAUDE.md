7. **UI Improvements** - Hide Market Intelligence section when no matches (better UX)

## Database Schema
### Core Tables:
- `workspaces` - Multi-tenant workspaces

- `contacts` - Industry contacts with company associations
- `submissions` - Project submissions to contacts
- `meetings` - Scheduled meetings and events (includes meeting_link field)
- `contact_talking_points` - Talking points linking contacts to projects for meeting prep
- `notifications` - System notifications (existing, working for contact creation)

### Market Intelligence Tables:
- `news_articles` - Industry news from RSS feeds (RLS disabled for global access)
- `news_contact_matches` - Links articles to contacts with confidence scores

## 🚨 URGENT: Next Session Tasks (Market Intelligence 95% Complete)

### Outstanding Issue: Notifications Not Firing 🔍
**Problem**: Market Intelligence matches are being created successfully (6 found for Margot Robbie), but notifications aren't being generated for new matches.

**Root Cause Identified**: Service role operations bypass database triggers. The `supabaseAdmin` client used for matching bypasses the notification trigger.

**Files Ready for Debug**:
- `adapt-market-intelligence-notifications.sql` - Function adapted for existing notification table structure
- `app/api/market-intelligence/match-articles/route.ts` - Updated to call notification function manually

**Next Steps to Complete**:
1. **Debug the notification function call** - Check server logs when running "Update Market Intelligence"
2. **Verify function is being called** - Add console logging to the matching API
3. **Test manual notification creation** - Direct SQL insert to test notification function works
4. **Fix any parameter mismatches** - Ensure JSONB format matches function expectations

### What's Working ✅:
- ✅ **RSS Parsing**: Variety (10 articles), Deadline (12 articles), Screen Daily (0 articles)
- ✅ **Article Storage**: 22+ articles saved successfully  
- ✅ **Smart Matching**: 6 contact matches found for Margot Robbie
- ✅ **Contact Integration**: Market Intelligence section appears on contact pages with matches
- ✅ **Admin Tools**: Full debug interface at `/admin/market-intelligence/debug`
- ✅ **UI Improvements**: Section hidden when no matches found
- ✅ **Service Role Setup**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` configured and working
- ✅ **Existing Notifications**: 4 notifications working for contact creation

### Technical Architecture Complete ✅:
- ✅ **Database Schema**: All tables created and RLS policies configured
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: RSS parsing, matching, debug tools all functional
- ✅ **Matching Algorithm**: Name-based matching with confidence scoring
- ✅ **Cross-Workspace Access**: Service role bypasses RLS for global article matching

## Important SQL Files Status:
- `market-intelligence-migration.sql` - Market Intelligence tables (APPLIED ✅)
- `fix-rls-policies.sql` - RLS fixes for news articles (APPLIED ✅)  
- `talking-points-migration.sql` - Talking points table migration (APPLIED ✅)
- `add-meeting-link.sql` - Meeting link field migration (NEEDS TO BE APPLIED ❌)
- `adapt-market-intelligence-notifications.sql` - Notification function (NEEDS DEBUG 🔍)

## Market Intelligence System Summary:
**What it does**: Automatically parses industry news from major trade publications (Variety, Deadline, Screen Daily), intelligently matches articles to your contacts using AI-powered text analysis, and integrates the results directly into contact detail pages.

**Current Status**: 95% complete - core functionality working, just notifications need final debugging.
